## October 8th 2022

I created the repository for my final project [**Topic-modeling-literacy-education-scholarship**](https://github.com/Data-Sci-2022/Topic-modeling-literacy-education-scholarship). I followed the instructions and prepared the required files.

## October 11th and 12th 2022

I finished the documents required for the beginning of the Final project repository: 

  - [Project plan](project_plan.md).
  - [README](README.md)
  - [Progress report](progress_report.md).

For the purpose of the Project plan document, I studied more about topic modeling in my main sources: [Eight to late](https://eight2late.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/a-gentle-introduction-to-topic-modeling-using-r/) and [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/index.html).
