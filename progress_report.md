# Progress report

----------------
## October 8th 2022

I created the repository for my final project [**Topic-modeling-literacy-education-scholarship**](https://github.com/Data-Sci-2022/Topic-modeling-literacy-education-scholarship). I followed the instructions and prepared the required files.

## October 11th and 12th 2022

I finished the documents required for the beginning of the Final project repository: 

  - [Project plan](project_plan.md).
  - [README](README.md)
  - [Progress report](progress_report.md).

For the purpose of the Project plan document, I studied more about topic modeling in my main sources: [Eight to late](https://eight2late.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/a-gentle-introduction-to-topic-modeling-using-r/) and [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/index.html).

# First Progress Report

## November 3rd 2022

For this progress report, I collect, pre-processing the data and prepared a data frame ready for the topic modeling analysis. Unfortunately, I had many problems with "parsing", and I could not work with all the data; I had to come back and work with a subgroup to test the procedure to clean the data. The details are in my [Data_processing2](Data_processing2.md) document. I am following the book [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/index.html) as my base. 

* **sharing plan**

My sharing plan does not have so much change from what I described in my [Project plan](project_plan.md). I still cannot share the data publicly. However, I plan to consult about the possibility of sharing a sample of open access articles in my repository. This plan will be resolved in the next days. In the meantime, I shared a sample of what will be my base data frame in an `.Rds` file inside [Data_samples](/Data_samples).
