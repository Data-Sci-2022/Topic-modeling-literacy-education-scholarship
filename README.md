# Topic modeling of Literacy Education articles: five decades of scholarship

--------
## Description

Gianina Morales's Data Science term project - Applying topic modeling to literacy education articles

## Summary

Topic modeling is a data mining and machine learning technique that automatically analyzes texts to identify latent topic structures. The most widely used model in humanities is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). I will use topic modeling techniques to analyze the trends over time in literacy research and scholarship in a leading journal in the field of Literacy education. My research questions are:

1. What are the trends in topics of literacy education research and scholarship over more than five decades (1969-2021) of the focal journal?
2. How do the topics have changed over time?
