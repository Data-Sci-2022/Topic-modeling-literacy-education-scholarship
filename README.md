## Description

A perennial interest of researchers is understanding the history and characteristics of their fields. Topic modeling is a data mining and machine learning technique that automatically analyzes texts to identify latent topic structures. I used topic modeling techniques to analyze the trends over time in literacy research and scholarship in one leading journal and a conference papers journal in the field of Literacy education. My research questions are: 

1. What are the trends in topics of literacy education research and scholarship over more than five decades (1969-2022) of the focal journals?
2.  How do the topics have changed over time?

## Data sets

3,131 journal articles that represent all the publications between 1969 and 2022 in the focal journals. I obtained the data as part of a major research project and for a confidential agreement, I cannot share the raw data. However, I put the tidy data that GitHub allowed (by weight) after mining the texts in this [folder](Data_product_samples).
