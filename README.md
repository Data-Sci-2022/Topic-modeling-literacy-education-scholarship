# Topic modeling of Literacy Education articles: five decades of scholarship

--------
## Description

Gianina Morales's Data Science term project - Applying topic modeling to literacy education articles

## Summary

Topic modeling is a data mining and machine learning technique that automatically analyzes texts to identify latent topic structures. The most widely used model in humanities is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). I will use topic modeling techniques to analyze the trends over time in literacy research and scholarship in one leading journal and a conference papers journal in the field of Literacy education, both pertaining to the same disciplinary association. My research questions are: 

1. What are the trends in topics of literacy education research and scholarship over more than five decades (1969-2022) of the focal journals?
2.  How do the topics have changed over time?
